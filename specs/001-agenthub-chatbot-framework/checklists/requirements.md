# Specification Quality Checklist: AgentHub Multi-Agent Chatbot Framework

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-28
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Validation Notes**:
- ✅ Spec avoids implementation specifics, focuses on WHAT and WHY
- ✅ User stories clearly articulate business value (P1: debt queries, config-driven agents, multi-tenant security)
- ✅ Language is accessible, uses business terminology
- ✅ All mandatory sections present: User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Scope, Dependencies, Constraints

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Validation Notes**:
- ✅ Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements derived from business docs
- ✅ All 59 functional requirements use concrete, testable language (MUST + specific action)
- ✅ 12 success criteria defined with specific metrics (e.g., "95% of queries < 2.5s", "100+ tenants", "95%+ routing accuracy")
- ✅ Success criteria avoid tech details - use user-facing outcomes (e.g., "users retrieve debt info in under 2.5s" not "API response time < 200ms")
- ✅ All 7 user stories have Given/When/Then acceptance scenarios (4 scenarios per P1 story)
- ✅ 8 detailed edge cases covering JWT expiry, API failures, intent ambiguity, quota limits, connection pool exhaustion, injection attacks, concurrent updates, ChromaDB unavailability
- ✅ Scope explicitly lists in-scope (12 items) and out-of-scope future enhancements (10 items)
- ✅ Dependencies section covers external systems (3), infrastructure (5), software libraries (7), dev tools (3)
- ✅ Assumptions section documents 10 clear assumptions (auth provider, external APIs, DB schema, API keys, etc.)

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Validation Notes**:
- ✅ 59 functional requirements organized into 11 logical categories (Chat Interaction, SupervisorAgent, Domain Agents, Tool Loading, Multi-Tenant, LLM Management, Output Formatting, Security, Admin API, Sessions, RAG, Monitoring)
- ✅ 7 user stories prioritized (P1: core flows, P2: advanced features, P3: RAG) - each independently testable
- ✅ Success criteria align with user stories: SC-001 validates US1 (debt queries), SC-002 validates US2 (config-driven), SC-007 validates US3 (multi-tenant isolation)
- ✅ Specification maintains business perspective throughout - no FastAPI routes, no LangChain class names, no Redis commands in spec body (only in constitution/context docs)

## Notes

**All checklist items passed!** ✅

The specification is complete, comprehensive, and ready for the next phase.

**Key Strengths**:
1. **Excellent prioritization**: P1 user stories establish clear MVP - debt queries, config-driven architecture, and multi-tenant security
2. **Comprehensive requirements**: 59 FRs cover all aspects from chat interaction to monitoring
3. **Strong testability**: Every user story has independent test criteria, all requirements are measurable
4. **Clear boundaries**: Scope explicitly excludes 10 future enhancements, preventing scope creep
5. **Risk awareness**: 9 identified risks with concrete mitigation strategies
6. **Technology-agnostic success criteria**: All 12 success criteria describe user/business outcomes without implementation details

**Ready for**: `/speckit.plan` (implementation planning) - No clarifications needed!
